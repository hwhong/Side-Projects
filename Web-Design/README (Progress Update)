Updates (Mid April 2016 ~ April 24th 2016)
- I started this project around mid April, and since had made some small progresses. I've learned much about how the layout
of the website works as well as the use of containers (div) to make more customizations on the website. The thing that I was
quite surprised by how hard it was for me to make text fields and containers to be at places that I want them to be in. I found
out I was guessing where the coordinate may be (using magic numbers) rather than actually coding in a smart way. I am still
quite confused as to how to place pictures on my website. I've tried to access multiple website's page source and see how 
they have implemented it, but had no luck at actually understanding the use of it. 
Color is quite important when it comes to building a website. I discovered that the current color of my website may be a little
dull and unintersting (maybe because it is still lacking contents), but I should probably learn more on color compositions. 
Another intersting thing learned was how to put characters other than english onto the website, pretty cool! 

- Things to work: 
a) how to place containers and texts at places that I want them to be in 
b) Look into how to put big, pretty pictures on website.
c) recently learned about node.js and such, maybe look into those as well?
